# Refresh Reminder 
Your digital health monitor :) - Prototype for Innovaccer HackerCamp-2022 (Theme Connecting the virtual Trio- Work , Health & Life)


## What is it?

Refresh Reminder helps users improve not only their physical health but also their work productivity by tracking their on-screen time and giving them a soft nudge to take timely breaks and guides the users through optimal exercises via our AR model. Further, it notifys them about possible lapses in eye blinking and improper face-to-screen distance. The application can also be accessed by motion gestures thus keeping the user away from their digital devices. 

## Features

1. Screen to face distance tracker
2. Blink detection
3. Exercise suggestions
4. Sedentary Time Usage
5. Motion gesture controls
